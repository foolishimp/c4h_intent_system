      Enhance the asset manager to properly handle absolute and relative paths:
      1. Add project_root tracking to determine relative paths from config
      2. Add _get_relative_path method to maintain structure
      3. Modify _get_next_backup_path to preserve directory structure under backups
      4. Add detailed path logging for debugging
      5. Use Path.resolve() and relative_to() for reliable path calculations
      6. Ensure all parent directories are created for backups
      The changes must preserve all existing functionality:
      - Keep existing backup timestamp format
      - Maintain all current backup operations
      - Keep existing error handling
      - Preserve all existing config options
